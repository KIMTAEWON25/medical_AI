# MRI Modality (t1ce, bb, others) Classification

This repository includes an MRI Modality Classification model that sorts MRI images into specific sequences: 

T1-weighted post-contrast (T1ce), Black Blood (BB), and other sequences. The model is designed to analyze scans across three different axial, sagittal, and coronal utilize the full spectrum of spatial information available in brain tissue imaging.
