# MRI Modality (t1ce, bb, others) Classification

This repository contains the implementation of an MRI Modality Classification model designed to categorize MRI scans into distinct sequences such as T1-weighted post-contrast (T1ce), Brain with Bone (BB), and others. The model processes images in three planes - axial, sagittal, and coronal - to fully leverage the spatial information of brain tissues.
