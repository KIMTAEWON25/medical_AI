# MRI Modality (t1ce, bb, others) Classification

This repository contains the implementation of an MRI Modality Classification model designed to categorize MRI scans into distinct sequences such as T1ce, BB, others. The model processes images in three planes - axial, sagittal, and coronal - to fully leverage the spatial information of brain tissues.
